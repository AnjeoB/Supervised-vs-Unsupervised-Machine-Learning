\# Supervised vs Unsupervised Machine Learning



This project demonstrates the differences between \*\*Supervised\*\* and \*\*Unsupervised\*\* machine learning using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.



\## 📁 Contents



\- `Vehicle Clustering.ipynb` — Unsupervised Learning (Clustering example with Seaborn and Scikit-learn)

\- `Predicting Building Energy Efficiency.ipynb` — Supervised Learning (Regression with Random Forest)



\## 🔧 Technologies Used



\- Python 3.x

\- Jupyter Notebook

\- NumPy, Pandas

\- Scikit-learn

\- Matplotlib \& Seaborn



\## 🚀 How to Run



1\. Install Jupyter Notebook and required libraries:



```bash

pip install notebook numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Launch Jupyter:



bash

Copy

Edit

jupyter notebook

Open the .ipynb files and run each cell.



📌 Notes

Make sure to have a valid Python environment set up.



You can modify the notebooks to try different models or datasets.
